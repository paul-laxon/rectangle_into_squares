Code Wars project

The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).

Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?

You will be given two dimensions

    a positive integer length (parameter named lng)
    a positive integer width (parameter named wdth)

You will return an array or a string (depending on the language; Shell bash and Fortran return a string) with the size of each of the squares.
